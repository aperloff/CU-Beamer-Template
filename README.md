This is my personal Beamer (LaTeX) presentation template for the University of Colorado Boulder.

# Installation
There is a python installation script for the custom LaTex style files. Every effort has been made to make this installation script work for both Linux and OSX. An example installation command would be:
```bash
python install.py
```
More help can be found by doing:
```bash
python install.py -h
```
